# AR-Environment-Skeleton

You can use this repo to build new Activerecord projects

* You will need to create your own app/models directories


AR created: 
- Student#grade_level should return the student’s grade level
- Student.all should return a list of all students


Self-created:
- Student#full_name should return the first and last name of the student in one string, for ex: “Ian Grubb”
- Student.all_in_grade should receive an argument of a grade, ex: “first”, and return all students who are in that grade
- Teacher#tenure should return true if a teacher has taught more than 5 years, otherwise false
You should have a completed seeds file for testing


AR automatically anticipates several common methods - variable accessors, 'all', etc. Anything special/atypical we will have to create for ourselves.s
